# User Validation with CSV File

### The goal for this assignment will be to mimic a user login from a Java console application.

### You will prompt a user for a username and a password, and then use the inputs you receive to validate whether or not the username / password combination is valid.

### In order to validate this username / password combination, you'll need to read this information from a file (called "data.txt") and import the data into your Java application

### You should create a User POJO that will store the information that will be read from the file.

## The User POJO should contain three properties:

 ### 1. username
 ### 2. password
 ### 3. name

### The file information should be stored in your Java application as an Array of User objects.

### Once this data is appropriately stored in your Java application, you can begin the process of prompting for username and password.
